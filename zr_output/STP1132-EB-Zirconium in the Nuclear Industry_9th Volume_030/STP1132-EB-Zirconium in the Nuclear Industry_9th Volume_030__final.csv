STP1132-EB-Zirconium in the Nuclear Industry_9th Volume_030_chunk1,text,Charquet et al. [10] have thoroughly examined the separate and combined solubility of Fe and Cr in the α-phase of alloys resembling the Zircaloys. They found that the highest combined solubility of Fe + Cr was 150 weight ppm at 810°C in a Zry-1.4Sn alloy with a Fe-to-Cr ratio similar to that in Zry-4.,Zry-1.4Sn,α-phase,,,,"{'value': None, 'unit': None}",,"{'value': None, 'unit': None}","{'value': None, 'unit': None}",,,,,,,,,,,,,810.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
